These non-GAAP measures are often used to supplement GAAP financial measures and provide additional information to investors about a company's financial performance.\n\nThe graph includes the following columns:\n\n- As Reported: This is the GAAP financial measure.\n- Non-GAAP: This is the non-GAAP financial measure.\n- As Adjusted: This is the non-GAAP financial measure adjusted for certain items.\n- Non-GAAP: This is the non-GAAP financial measure adjusted for certain items.\n\nThe items that are adjusted are not specified in the image, but they typically include items such as stock-based compensation, acquisition-related costs, and other items that are not considered part of the company's core operating performance.\n\nThe graph also includes a column for \"As Reported,\" which is the GAAP financial measure, and a column for \"Non-GAAP,\" which is the non-GAAP financial measure. The \"As Adjusted\" and \"Non-GAAP\" columns are the adjusted and non-adjusted versions of the non-GAAP financial measure, respectively.\n\nThe graph is a financial tool used by investors and analysts to compare the company's financial performance on a GAAP basis with its non-GAAP performance, which can provide a clearer picture of the company's underlying financial health."
